    <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Philippine Government Contributions (2026/2025 Updates)</h2>
    <p>
      In the Philippines, understanding your mandatory government contributions is essential for both employees and
      employers. Every month, specific portions of your gross salary are deducted to fund your social insurance (SSS),
      health coverage (PhilHealth), and housing fund (Pag-IBIG). These contributions are not just deductions; they are
      investments into your long-term security, providing safety nets for sickness, maternity, retirement, and emergency
      loans.
    </p>

    <h2>Detailed Breakdown of Mandatory Deductions</h2>

    <h3>1. SSS (Social Security System) Contribution Table</h3>
    <p>
      The SSS acts as the primary social safety net for private-sector workers. It offers cash assistance during times
      of sickness, maternity leave, disability, and eventually, a monthly pension upon retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Current Rate:</strong> As of the latest implemented schedule (2025 onwards), the total SSS contribution
      rate stands at <strong>14%</strong> of your Monthly Salary Credit (MSC). However, this burden is not entirely
      yours. It is shared between you and your employer:
    </p>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Employee Share:</strong> 4.5%</li>
      <li><strong>Employer Share:</strong> 9.5%</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>WISP Explained:</strong> High-income earners (those with an MSC above ₱20,000) are automatically enrolled
      in the <strong>Worker's Investment and Savings Program (WISP)</strong>. This acts as a mandatory provident fund,
      securing an additional layer of retirement savings on top of your regular pension. The contribution for WISP is
      also split between you and your employer, proportional to the excess of your MSC over ₱20,000.
    </p>

    <h3>2. PhilHealth Premium Rate</h3>
    <p>
      PhilHealth is the government corporation tasked to implement the National Health Insurance Program. It
      significantly reduces hospitalization costs and provides financial risk protection from medical expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Current Rate:</strong> Guided by the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law, the premium rate is currently set at
      <strong>5.0%</strong>. Just like SSS, this premium is split 50/50 between the employer and the employee (each
      paying 2.5%). The law sets a minimum income floor (₱10,000) and a maximum income ceiling (up to ₱90,000 or
      ₱100,000 depending on final circular releases). If you earn above the ceiling, your contribution is capped at the
      maximum set amount.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Pag-IBIG Fund (Home Development Mutual Fund)</h3>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of Pag-IBIG is to provide affordable shelter financing to Filipinos. It also serves as a
      high-yielding national savings program.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Current Rate:</strong> The calculation for Pag-IBIG Regular Savings is straightforward. For most employees
      earning above ₱1,500 monthly, the contribution rate is 2% and the employer counterpart is also 2%. However, the
      maximum compensation used as the basis for this calculation is capped at ₱5,000.
      <br><br>
      Consequently, the maximum mandatory contribution for most employees is a flat <strong>₱100 per month</strong> (2%
      of ₱5,000), matched by another ₱100 from the employer.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Example: SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG Deductions</h2>
    <div class="example-box">
      <h3>Scenario: Maria earns ₱25,000 a month</h3>
      <p>Maria is a newly hired graphic designer. Let's compute her deductions based on her ₱25,000 basic salary.</p>

      <h4>SSS / WISP</h4>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li>Her MSC falls under the ₱25,000 bracket.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular SSS (Employee):</strong> 4.5% of ₱20,000 limit = ₱900</li>
        <li><strong>WISP (Employee):</strong> 4.5% of excess (₱5,000) = ₱225</li>
        <li><strong>Total SSS Deduction:</strong> ₱1,125</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">PhilHealth</h4>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><strong>Total Premium:</strong> 5.0% of ₱25,000 = ₱1,250</li>
        <li><strong>Employee Share (50%):</strong> ₱625</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Pag-IBIG</h4>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><strong>Employee Share:</strong> 2% of maximum cap (₱5,000) = ₱100</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Maria's Total Monthly Deduction:</strong> ₱1,125 + ₱625 + ₱100 =
        <strong>₱1,850</strong>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>What is WISP in SSS?</h3>
      <p>The Worker's Investment and Savings Program (WISP) is a mandatory provident fund managed by SSS. It serves as
        an additional retirement savings program on top of the regular SSS pension for members whose Monthly Salary
        Credit (MSC) exceeds ₱20,000. When you retire, you receive your WISP contributions plus the investment income
        they generated.</p>

      <h3>Did PhilHealth rates increase in 2025?</h3>
      <p>Yes, as mandated by the Universal Health Care (UHC) Law, the PhilHealth premium rate was scheduled to increase
        to 5.0% of the basic monthly income, with the income ceiling adjusting to ₱90,000-₱100,000 depending on the
        final BIR and PhilHealth circular releases for the year.</p>

      <h3>Can I voluntarily pay more than the mandatory ₱100 Pag-IBIG contribution?</h3>
      <p>Yes, you certainly can opt to increase your monthly Pag-IBIG Regular Savings contribution through your
        employer's HR or via direct payment to save more. However, many Filipinos instead choose to enroll in the
        separate voluntary Modified Pag-IBIG II (MP2) program, as it traditionally yields higher, tax-free dividends
        while offering a fixed 5-year maturity period.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="note" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> SSS values use an algorithmic approximation (14% rate split 4.5%/9.5% plus EC where
      applicable). PhilHealth uses the 5% tier with a floor of ₱10,000 and the current ceiling. Pag-IBIG caps at a
      ₱5,000 base with 1–2% employee and 2% employer rates. Always refer to official government circulars closely for
      exact centavo figures.
