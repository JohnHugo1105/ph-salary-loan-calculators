  <h1>How to compute your SSS contribution in 2025</h1>
  <p>
    This guide explains a practical way to estimate your Social Security System (SSS) contribution for 2025.
    Employers typically use the official SSS contribution schedule based on Monthly Salary Credit (MSC). This article
    shows the idea behind the tables and a quick estimation method that matches most cases.
  </p>
  <h3>1) Understand MSC (Monthly Salary Credit)</h3>
  <p>
    Your salary is mapped to an MSC bracket. For estimation, a common approach is to round the monthly salary to the
    nearest ₱500 within the MSC min/max range, then apply the current contribution rates. The official table may differ
    slightly by brackets, but the approximation helps you forecast deductions.
  </p>
  <h3>2) Contribution split and EC</h3>
  <p>
    The combined SSS contribution is split between employee and employer. Employers also pay an EC (Employee’s
    Compensation) premium (often ₱10 or ₱30) depending on risk classification. Your payslip will typically show
    a smaller employee share and a larger employer share.
  </p>
  <h3>3) Quick estimate steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Take your monthly salary and round to the nearest ₱500 within the MSC min/max.</li>
    <li>Apply the prevailing SSS total rate (e.g., ~14%).</li>
    <li>Split approximately 4.5% employee and 9.5% employer.</li>
    <li>Add EC (₱10 or ₱30) to the employer side.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Example: Monthly salary ₱30,000. Rounded MSC ₱30,000. Total ≈ ₱4,200; employee ≈ ₱1,350; employer ≈ ₱2,850 + EC.
    Actual values depend on the official schedule.
  </p>
  <h3>4) Verify with the official table</h3>
  <p>
    Once you have an estimate, compare with the SSS circular or official contribution table for 2025. HR/payroll systems
    must follow SSS guidance; your employer’s numbers are authoritative for your payslip.
