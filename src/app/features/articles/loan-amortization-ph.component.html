  <h1>How loan amortization works in the Philippines</h1>
  <p>
    Most housing, car, and salary loans in the Philippines use fixed monthly amortization. Each payment has two parts:
    interest (cost of borrowing) and principal (the amount that reduces your outstanding balance). Over time, the
    interest portion declines while the principal portion grows.
  </p>
  <h3>The payment formula</h3>
  <p>
    Monthly payment depends on loan amount, term (months), and monthly interest rate. With a fixed-rate loan, the payment
    is constant and can be computed using the standard annuity formula used by banks and calculators.
  </p>
  <h3>Reading a schedule</h3>
  <p>
    In the first months, interest is higher because it’s computed on a larger balance. As you pay down the principal,
    the interest portion shrinks. The final balance reaches zero if you make all payments on schedule.
  </p>
  <h3>Practical tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare APR across lenders, not just monthly payments.</li>
    <li>Check for prepayment penalties and fees.</li>
    <li>Run “what-if” scenarios: longer term lowers payment but increases total interest.</li>
  </ul>
