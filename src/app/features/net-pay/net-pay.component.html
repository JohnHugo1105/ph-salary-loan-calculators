    <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Calculating Net Pay in the Philippines (2026)</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding your payslip is crucial for managing your personal finances. Whether you're a fresh graduate earning
      your first salary or an experienced professional negotiating a new job offer in the Philippines, knowing how to
      calculate your <strong>Net Pay</strong> (Take-Home Pay) from your <strong>Gross Salary</strong> gives you a
      clearer picture of your actual purchasing power.
    </p>

    <div class="formula-box example-box" style="margin: 1.5rem 0; font-family: monospace;">
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">The Basic Net Pay Formula</h3>
      <strong>Gross Pay</strong> (Basic Salary + Overtime + Holiday Pay + Taxable Allowances)<br>
      <strong>- Total Deductions</strong> (SSS + PhilHealth + Pag-IBIG)<br>
      <strong>- Withholding Tax</strong> (Based on BIR Tax Tables)<br>
      <hr style="border: 0; border-top: 1px solid currentColor; margin: 0.5rem 0; opacity: 0.2;">
      <strong>= Net Pay (Take-Home Pay)</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Breakdown: Where Does Your Money Go?</h2>
    <p>
      In the Philippines, every formally employed worker is subject to mandatory government deductions before taxes are
      even computed. Here is exactly what is taken out of your gross salary:
    </p>

    <h3>1. SSS (Social Security System)</h3>
    <p>
      The SSS provides social insurance for private-sector employees. It acts as a safety net, covering benefits for
      sickness, maternity, disability, retirement, and death. Your contribution amount is tiered based on your Monthly
      Salary Credit (MSC). Starting 2025, the maximum MSC was increased, meaning higher earners will see slightly larger
      SSS deductions but will also receive higher benefits upon retirement.
    </p>

    <h3>2. PhilHealth (Philippine Health Insurance Corporation)</h3>
    <p>
      PhilHealth is the national health insurance program designed to help Filipinos pay for medical care and hospital
      bills. By law, the premium rate is a percentage of your basic monthly salary, and this cost is split equally
      (50/50) between you and your employer.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Pag-IBIG (Home Development Mutual Fund or HDMF)</h3>
    <p>
      Pag-IBIG offers housing loans, calamity loans, and a highly competitive savings program (including the MP2). The
      standard mandatory contribution is 2% of your monthly compensation, capped at a specific salary base, keeping the
      standard monthly deduction at ₱100 to ₱200 for most employees.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Withholding Tax (Income Tax)</h3>
    <p>
      After SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG are deducted from your gross pay, the remaining amount is your <strong>Taxable
        Income</strong>. This is the figure used against the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) tax tables. Under the
      TRAIN Law (effective Jan 1, 2023 onwards), the income tax brackets were adjusted to lower the tax burden on
      middle-income earners. Those earning ₱250,000 annually (or roughly ₱20,833 monthly) and below are completely
      exempt from paying income tax.
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Example: Computing Net Pay</h2>
    <div class="example-box">
      <h3>Scenario: Juan earns ₱30,000 a month</h3>
      <p>Juan works in Metro Manila and has a basic salary of ₱30,000 with no other allowances.</p>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><strong>Gross Pay:</strong> ₱30,000</li>
        <li><strong>SSS Deduction (Employee Share):</strong> ~₱1,350</li>
        <li><strong>PhilHealth Deduction (Employee Share):</strong> ~₱750</li>
        <li><strong>Pag-IBIG Deduction:</strong> ₱200</li>
        <li><em>Total Government Deductions:</em> ₱2,300</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>Taxable Income:</strong> ₱30,000 - ₱2,300 = ₱27,700</p>
      <p>Using the BIR Train Law regular tables, the tax on ₱27,700 is approximately ₱1,035.</p>
      <p><strong>Juan's Take-Home Net Pay:</strong> ₱30,000 - ₱2,300 (Govt) - ₱1,035 (Tax) = <strong>₱26,665</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Are Allowances Taxable? (De Minimis Benefits)</h2>
    <p>
      Not all allowances are subject to income tax. <strong>De Minimis benefits</strong> are facilities or privileges
      furnished or offered by an employer to its employees that are of relatively small value and are offered merely as
      a means of promoting health, goodwill, contentment, or efficiency of employees.
    </p>
    <p>Because they are <strong>exempt from income tax</strong>, they are a great way for employers to increase your
      take-home pay without increasing your tax burden. Common examples include:</p>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Rice Subsidy:</strong> Up to ₱2,000 per month.</li>
      <li><strong>Uniform/Clothing Allowance:</strong> Up to ₱6,000 per year.</li>
      <li><strong>Medical Cash Allowance:</strong> Up to ₱1,500 per semester (for dependents).</li>
      <li><strong>Laundry Allowance:</strong> Up to ₱300 per month.</li>
      <li><strong>Monetized Vacation Leave:</strong> Up to 10 days of unused leave credits.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is My 13th Month Pay Taxable?</h2>
    <p>
      Under Philippine tax law, 13th-month pay and other equivalent benefits (like Christmas bonuses or productivity
      incentives) are <strong>exempt from income tax up to a maximum of ₱90,000</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if your 13th-month pay is ₱50,000 and you receive a Christmas bonus of ₱20,000 (Total: ₱70,000), the
      entire amount is tax-free because it is under the ₱90,000 threshold. However, if your 13th-month pay is ₱100,000,
      the first ₱90,000 is tax-free, and the remaining ₱10,000 will be added to your gross taxable income for that
      respective period.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>What is the difference between Gross Pay and Net Pay in the Philippines?</h3>
      <p>Gross pay is your total earned income before any deductions are made (including basic rate, overtime, and
        allowances). Net pay, often called take-home pay, is the final amount deposited into your bank account after
        mandatory government contributions (SSS, PhilHealth, Pag-IBIG/HDMF) and BIR withholding taxes have been
        deducted.</p>

      <h3>Are de minimis benefits taxable?</h3>
      <p>No. De minimis benefits (such as rice subsidy, clothing allowance, and medical cash allowance) are considered
        reasonably small facilities or privileges furnished by an employer to its employees and are completely exempt
        from income tax, making them a highly tax-efficient form of compensation.</p>

      <h3>Is holiday pay legally required in the Philippines?</h3>
      <p>Yes, the Philippine Labor Code specifically mandates holiday pay. If you do not work on a regular holiday, you
        are still entitled to 100% of your daily wage. If you work on a regular holiday, you must be paid 200%. For
        special non-working days, the "no work, no pay" principle applies; however, if you are required to work, you are
        entitled to an additional 30% premium on top of your basic daily wage.</p>
