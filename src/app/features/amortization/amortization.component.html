    <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Loan Amortization in the Philippines (2026)</h2>
    <p>
      Whether you are applying for a housing loan through Pag-IBIG or a commercial bank, financing a new car, or
      taking out a salary loan for an emergency, understanding how your monthly amortization is computed is essential
      for sound financial planning. This gives you foresight into exactly how much of your hard-earned money goes into
      paying down your debt versus how much is lost to interest charges over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This calculator assumes a standard fixed-rate loan structure using the diminishing balance method—the standard
      used by major Philippine banks like BDO, BPI, Metrobank, Security Bank, and government agencies like Pag-IBIG.
    </p>

    <h2>What is a Diminishing Balance Interest Rate?</h2>
    <p>
      Most formal, long-term loans in the Philippines use the <strong>Diminishing Balance</strong> method. This means
      that your interest charge is calculated based on the <strong>remaining principal balance</strong> each month,
      not on the original amount you borrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>How the math works:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li>In the early years of your loan, a massive chunk of your monthly payment goes directly to
        <strong>Interest</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>As you continue to make monthly payments, your principal balance decreases. Because the principal is
        smaller, the interest charged computation also shrinks.</li>
      <li>Towards the end of your loan term, almost your entire monthly payment goes towards wiping out the remaining
        <strong>Principal</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="note">
      <em>Note: This is vastly different from "Add-on Rate" loans (often used for quick cash loans, credit card
        installment plans, or appliance financing), where the interest is fixed on the original principal amount for
        the entire duration. The diminishing balance method is generally much fairer and cheaper for borrowers on
        long-term loans.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Practical Example: 5-Year Car Loan vs. 20-Year Housing Loan</h2>
    <div class="example-box">
      <h3>Scenario A: 5-Year Car Loan (₱1,000,000 at 8% per annum)</h3>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> ₱20,276.40</li>
        <li><strong>Total Interest Paid over 5 Years:</strong> ₱216,583.74</li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem"><em>Notice how the monthly payment is high, but the total interest is kept
            relatively low because the principal is paid off quickly over 60 months.</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">Scenario B: 20-Year Housing Loan (₱1,000,000 at 8% per annum)</h3>
      <ul style="margin-bottom: 0;">
        <li><strong>Monthly Payment:</strong> ₱8,364.40</li>
        <li><strong>Total Interest Paid over 20 Years:</strong> ₱1,007,456.36</li>
        <li style="margin-top: 0.5rem"><em>Notice how the monthly payment is much more affordable. However, because
            you are stretching the debt over 240 months, you end up paying more in interest than the actual principal
            borrowed.</em></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Effective Strategies to Lower Your Monthly Amortization</h2>
    <p>
      If the calculated monthly payment looks too high for your current budget, here are practical, actionable ways to
      lower it before signing the loan contract:
    </p>
    <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Extend the Loan Term:</strong> Stretching a housing loan from 10 years to 20 years will
        significantly drop your monthly bill. Just remember the trade-off: you will pay significantly more total
        interest over the life of the loan.</li>
      <li><strong>Increase Your Downpayment:</strong> Paying 30% upfront instead of the minimum 20% drastically
        reduces the principal amount you need to borrow, thus shrinking both your monthly payments and total interest.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Improve Your Credit Score for a Lower Rate:</strong> Banks reserve their lowest promotional rates
        for "prime" clients with excellent credit histories or those offering highly liquid collateral.</li>
      <li><strong>Compare Rates:</strong> Pag-IBIG frequently offers subsidized, lower interest rates for low-income
        earners compared to aggressive commercial banks. Always request sample computations from at least three
        institutions.</li>
      <li><strong>Make Advance Payments to Principal:</strong> Check your loan contract. If your bank allows it
        without heavy penalties, making lump-sum payments applied directly to the principal can drastically shorten
        your loan term and cut interest costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Understanding Fixing and Repricing Periods</h3>
    <p>
      In the Philippines, very few housing loans offer a completely fixed rate for 20 years. Instead, banks offer a
      "Fixing Period" or "Repricing Period."
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you choose a <strong>3-year fixing period</strong> on a 15-year loan at 6.5%, that 6.5% rate is
      guaranteed for the first 36 months. On your 37th month, the bank will "reprice" or adjust your rate based on
      current BSP benchmark rates and market conditions. If inflation is high, your rate might jump to 8.0%, suddenly
      increasing your monthly amortization. Always budget with a margin of safety for potential future rate hikes.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
    <div class="faq-section">
      <h3>What is a diminishing balance interest rate?</h3>
      <p>A diminishing balance interest rate means that the interest is calculated based on the remaining principal
        balance of the loan each month, not the original borrowed amount. As you pay off the principal with every
        monthly amortization, the interest portion of your payment steadily decreases.</p>

      <h3>What is a repricing period for a housing loan?</h3>
      <p>A repricing period (also known as a fixing period) is the duration for which your initial interest rate is
        contractually guaranteed to stay the same. After this period (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, 5 years), the bank will
        adjust or 'reprice' your interest rate based on current economic market conditions. This repricing can either
        increase or decrease your required monthly amortization.</p>

      <h3>Is it better to have a 5-year or 20-year loan term?</h3>
      <p>It depends entirely on your monthly cash flow versus your long-term goals. A 5-year term will demand
        significantly higher monthly payments, but you will pay drastically less total interest to the bank. A 20-year
        term spreads the payments out to be much lower and more budget-friendly month-to-month, but yields much higher
        total interest costs overall (often doubling the price of the property).</p>
