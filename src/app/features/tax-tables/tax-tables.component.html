        <h2>1. Overview of the Revised Withholding Tax Table (TRAIN Law)</h2>
        <p>
            The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law, officially Republic Act No. 10963, brought
            monumental shifts to the Philippine taxation system. One of its most celebrated features was the
            restructuring of personal income tax brackets to significantly increase the take-home pay of millions of
            Filipino workers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Effective January 1, 2023, the Philippines transitioned into the second phase of this tax reform, lowering
            the rates even further for most low to middle-class earners. The simplified, graduated schedule below
            applies to all compensation income earners:

        <h3>How to Compute Your Tax (Sample Calculation)</h3>
        <p>
            Tax computation is progressive. Let's say your <strong>Taxable Income</strong> (Gross Pay minus non-taxable
            SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG contributions) is exactly <strong>P500,000</strong> per year.
        </p>
        <ol class="styled-list">
            <li>Find your bracket: P500,000 falls in the range <strong>"Over P400,000 to P800,000"</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Base Fixed Tax:</strong> Look at the flat amount for that tier, which is P22,500.</li>
            <li><strong>Excess Calculation:</strong> P500,000 - the floor of P400,000 = P100,000 excess.</li>
            <li><strong>Rate on Excess:</strong> Multiply 20% rate by the P100,000 excess = P20,000.</li>
            <li><strong>Total Annual Tax:</strong> P22,500 + P20,000 = <strong>P42,500</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To find your estimated monthly tax deduction, simply divide by 12: <strong>P3,541.67</strong> per month.
            <em>Remember: A proper 13th-month pay (up to P90,000) is excluded from this taxable income.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>2. SSS Contribution Schedule Matrix (The 14% Era)</h2>
        <p>
            Pursuant to the Social Security Act of 2018 (Republic Act No. 11199), the Social Security System (SSS)
            contribution rate was legally mandated to incrementally rise to secure the fund's viability. The total
            contribution rate currently stands at <strong>14%</strong> (4.5% Employee share, 9.5% Employer share).
            <br><em>Note: This table automatically includes the Mandatory Provident Fund (WISP) component for those
                earning incomes above P20,000.</em>

        <h3>Understanding The WISP Era</h3>
        <p>
            If you earn more than P20,000 per month, you are automatically enrolled in the <strong>Workers' Investment
                and Savings Program (WISP)</strong>. This serves as an additional savings and investment layer managed
            by the government. It yields interest tax-free, and the accumulated amount is added on top of your regular
            retirement pension later in life.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <h3>What is the TRAIN law tax exemption limit?</h3>
            <p>Under the TRAIN Law, compensation income earners with an annual taxable income of <strong>₱250,000 and
                    below</strong> are completely exempt from paying personal income tax. This means if your basic
                taxable pay is roughly ₱20,833 or less per month, your income tax withholding is ₱0.</p>

            <h3>What happens if I have multiple employers?</h3>
            <p>If you have multiple employers during the same calendar year—either concurrently or successively—you are
                no longer eligible for "Substituted Filing." Even if your employers withheld the correct tax, you must
                consolidate your income and file your own Annual Income Tax Return (BIR Form 1700) directly with the
                Bureau of Internal Revenue on or before April 15 of the following year.</p>

            <h3>Are my SSS and PhilHealth contributions taxable?</h3>
            <p>No. Your mandatory contributions to SSS, PhilHealth, and Pag-IBIG (up to the legally mandated limits) are
                classified as non-taxable deductions. Your employer must deduct these amounts from your Gross Income
                first; the resulting lower number is your true <i>Taxable Income</i>, upon which the BIR tax table is
                applied.</p>
